# VJEPA2EyeinHand
An attempt to use V-JEPA 2.0 for "eye-in-hand" robotic arm use.

The franka emika panda robotic arm is taken from the Mujoco Menagerie github. Their page can be found here: https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie 
We recommend you check out their work as well, for they are also doing great things.
